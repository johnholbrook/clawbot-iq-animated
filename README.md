# Clawbot IQ Animated Build Instructions
 
This page presents images and animations for each step required to build the VEX IQ Clawbot and Autopilot robots. These animations were previously available on the VEX Robotics website, and are refefenced in the build insturctions booklet included in the VEX IQ Super Kit.

The animations are [no longer avaialble](https://www.vexforum.com/t/404-error-clawbot-iq-animated-build-instructions/64073/10?u=holbrook) on the VEX site, but the underlying files have been [made available for download](https://www.vexforum.com/t/404-error-clawbot-iq-animated-build-instructions/64073/12?u=holbrook). This site is just a viewer for those images and video files.
